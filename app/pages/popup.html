            Thank you for using GeniuSpot! Please make sure the following steps are complete for the extension to work properly.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h2>How to Set Up</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Log in <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard" target="_blank">here</a> on spotify.com.</li>
                <li>Press "Create an App," and fill in "Name" and "Description" with whatever values you'd like.<br/>
                    <p class="text-light text-small">
                        If you're unsure, use something like "GeniuSpot Extension" for both. These names do not affect how the app works, so feel free to choose anything that helps you remember why you created it! Creating an app will not cost you any money.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>Agree to Spotify's terms and press "Create".</li>
                <li>Copy and paste your "Client ID" and "Client Secret" into the fields below, and press save.</li>
                    <p class="text-light text-small">
                        The ID and secret should each consist of 32 randomly-generated letters and numbers. These values are never stored anywhere other than your computer, and are only used to access Spotify search. You are not granting this extension any other access to your account.
                    </p>
                <li>Close and reopen this prompt.</li>
                    <p class="text-light text-small">
                        If both boxes are still filled in, your credentials have been successfully saved! That means you should be able to use GeniuSpot with no issues.
                    </p>
            </ol>
        </p>
